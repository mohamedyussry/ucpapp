  # MANUALLY LISTING DEPENDENCIES
  # Since we are uploading from Windows, we can't rely on the broken podhelper connection.
  # Codemagic will rebuild the flutter integration step anyway.
  
  # Core Flutter libs (Codemagic will inject these paths during its build phase)
  
  # List all your plugins here if the automatic integration fails, 
  # BUT usually, Codemagic's "Flutter build ipa" step handles the plugin registration automatically
  # BEFORE running pod install.
  
  # So we will revert to a very simple Podfile that lets Flutter tools manage the injection
